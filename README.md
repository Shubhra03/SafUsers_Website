This is the website to ease the use of users and it also has admin portal that verifies the status of every record

APPLICATION---
1.Similar to social media apps, if users come across these kinds of filthy locations, they publish photographs and information about the location and size in our app, and a report is submitted and forwarded to the administrator.
2.The municipal corporation may act as the administrator in this case. After analyzing the situation, they will allocate jobs to the local workers in that region.
3.We have created a web application for administrators in which they can see all the reports and on the basis of the resources available, they will assign the task to workers.
4.workers have a separate login and in this, they can see all the tasks assigned or todayâ€™s goals.
5.They can also track the location of the area with the help of maps and After completing the tasks they have to click the photos of that area and send a request to the administrator for approval.
